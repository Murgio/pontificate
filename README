Pontificate
-----------

Pontificate is a small web application built using Flask that allows users to create
and define their own words. This tool can be useful for those who want to expand their vocabulary
and add a touch of grandiosity to their language.

Pontificate is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and can be
accessed on your local network. It utilizes SQLite for storage,
providing a simple and reliable means of data management.
